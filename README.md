# Virtual-Clinic
Description In a Virtual Clinic (VC) all patients complete an online DASS21 survey - 21 questions with answers as integer numbers in the range [0..3]. Then a Doctor selects one patient for treatment and designs a program tailored for them. If there are patients that are similar to the chosen one it makes sense to reuse same plan for those patients.  In the VC custom Software identifies up to 5 most similar patients to assign the same treatment plan (patients whose survey answers are closest to the answers of the chosen patient).

Here I use both java and python to achieve this.
